# NewRYMGenerator

A tool used for automatically creating Spotify playlists from RYM lists.

Only caveat to using this tool is that it requires you download each page from the list (.html only) into a `/pages/` directory. This is due to RYM's somewhat recent implementation of Cloudflare protection.

Requires you have the appropriate environment variables set ffrom your Spotify application.
